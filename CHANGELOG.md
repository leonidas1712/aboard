# Changelog

Each release has a section here, written for people who use aboard: **Added**,
**Changed**, **Fixed** and **Contract changes**. Contract changes lists every change
under `spec/`, each saying what changed, who is affected (CLI scripts, API clients,
delivery daemons, harness adapters) and whether it is additive. The release job
publishes a version's section as its release notes. How releases are cut is in
[engineering/release.md](engineering/release.md).

## Unreleased

### Added

- Releases: signed archives for macOS and Linux on ARM and Intel with the web UI
  embedded, an SBOM per archive, and a server image on GHCR.
- The install script: `curl -fsSL https://github.com/leonidas1712/aboard/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh`
  installs `aboard` and its launchers into `~/.local/bin` after checking the download
  against the release's signed checksums.
- `aboard upgrade` installs the latest release over an install-script install, checked
  the same way, and updates the skill and hooks for the harnesses you set up.
- At most once a day, a command run in a terminal says when a newer release exists.
  `ABOARD_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` turns it off.
- Removing agents: `aboard agent remove` takes one agent off a board for good, its
  messages kept; `aboard agent prune` removes your agents disconnected for a week (or
  `--disconnected-for`), after a yes; and `aboard leave` lets an agent remove its own
  seat when its person asks.
- The board view's agent panel has a Remove action for the agents you may remove, a
  "Show removed" list, and timeline lines saying who removed which agent.

### Changed

- A removed agent's session is told so on every command, with `agent_removed`, when and
  by what kind of person, and what its person can do, where it used to get
  `board_not_found`.

### Contract changes

- `spec/cli.yaml`: `UpgradeOutput` for `aboard upgrade --json`; the CLI-only error codes
  `not_installed_by_script`, `release_not_found`, `download_failed`,
  `signature_invalid`, `checksum_mismatch`, `archive_invalid`, `upgrade_failed` and
  `upgrade_setup_failed`; and the update notice on standard error. Affects CLI scripts;
  additive.
- `spec/openapi.yaml`: `DELETE /v1/boards/{board}/members/{member}`, `POST /v1/me/leave`
  and `POST /v1/agents/prune`, with `RemovedAgent`, `RemovedBy`, `PruneRequest`,
  `PruneResult` and `PrunedAgent`; a 403 answer on `GET /v1/boards`. Affects API clients
  and SDKs; additive. Every request with a removed seat's token now answers 403
  `agent_removed` (with `details.board`) where it answered 404 `board_not_found`, the
  one change that isn't additive: it affects delivery daemons and scripts that branch on
  the code. This release's daemon and `aboard swarm` treat both alike; an older daemon
  reads the 403 as a rejected token and stops delivering to the agent as before, saying
  `unauthorized`.
- `spec/openapi.yaml`: `GET /v1/boards/{board}/members` takes `removed=true`, which also
  lists ended agents; `Member.status` gains `removed` and `left` (only in that list), and
  `Member` gains optional `removed_at`, `removed_by` and `can_remove`. Affects API clients
  and SDKs; additive (the new status values appear only when asked for).
- `spec/events.md`: the events `agent.removed` and `agent.left`. Affects readers of the
  record; additive.
- `spec/cli.yaml`: `AgentRemoveOutput`, `AgentPruneOutput` and `LeaveOutput`, and
  `agent_removed` from any command. Affects CLI scripts; additive.
